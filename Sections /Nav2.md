# Section 2 : Setup and Installation for ROS2 and Nav2
## Setup and installation 
we are going to use `ROS2 Humble` with `Ubuntu 22.04`

## PLEASE READ - DO NOT USE ROS2 FOXY
I'm just adding a quick note here to urge you not to use ROS2 Foxy, and instead go with a recent and supported version, such as ROS2 Humble.

The reason for this note is that many are still trying to work with Nav2 and Foxy, and unfortunately there are a lot of bugs and hard-to-solve issues. Also, the Simple Commander API won't work in Foxy.

And there is simply no solution to that, as Foxy is not supported anymore.

So, I strongly recommend that you install Ubuntu 22.04 and ROS2 Humble.

If you are still on Ubuntu 20.04, it might seem like a lot of setup and wasted time.

I can guarantee you that you will waste way more time trying to fix issues with Nav2 on ROS2 Foxy.

So, take the time to install ROS2 Humble, and this small time investment will actually save you a lot of time in the mid/long term :)
